Hello, 
I am new to coding. I am a father of four and have the most loving and caring wife. I am trying to learn code because first and foremost I am facinated with it. Im not young, I have worked my whole life in manufacturing and the business is going under. So i thought it was time to shift my focus to something that I could use to provide for my family, and that I actually enjoyed doing.
